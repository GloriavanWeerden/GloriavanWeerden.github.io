I was born and raised in Guelph, Ontario, where I went to Cornerstone Christian School for elementary and Emmanuel Christian High School where I was voted class valedictorian. I started my first job at the age of five, delivering newspapers around the neighborhood, till I was fifteen. At the same time, I began working part-time at Tim Horton's, where I still work presently. Some minor jobs I have also worked would be Royal City Nursery as a peak season worker, Hanlon Convention Center as a server, Lodder Brothers Plumbing as a landscaper and at Premier Printing Limited for one summer, running Xerox printers. 

In addition to this, I was the part-time employee at the family business, Rathfon Machine and Tool, till the closure in 2018.

In conclusion, I would say that I am a dependable worker, who enjoys finishing jobs in a complete and thorough manner.
