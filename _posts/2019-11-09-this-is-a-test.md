This cabin was constructed in the north of the Netherlands, as a retreat for metropolitan dwellers hoping to escape the digital pollution. The design incorporates poplar arches as support. The arches create a dome structure, much like that of a chapel. In historic religious architecture, this shape marked the shelter between what was on earth and the supernatural.
