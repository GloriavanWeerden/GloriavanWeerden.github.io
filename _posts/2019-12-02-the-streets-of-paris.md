During the days of Napoleon, Paris was at the heart of civil unrest. There were often uprisings unrest within the city. This led to rebellions barricading the narrow streets of Paris, inhibiting the army from getting to and squelching the uprising, causing it to snowball. When Napoleon became Emperor, he hired Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann to rebuild the city. Haussmann, a self-proclaimed artist-demolitionist, bulldozed through much of Paris to make room for wide boulevards. This allowed for armies to get through the city quickly, and were to wide to barricade.  Another purpose of the demolition was to break up the seedier areas of the city.

While being one of  the most controversial urban plans, it was very effective. and the effects can still be seen to this day. The pockets of the city were opened to the rest of the city, and improved the  transportation through the city.
